# Stitchmate

Stitchmate is a knitting companion app that simplifies row counting with features like click tracking, versatile counting options & customizable reminders.

Counting rows in knitting is like keeping track of the steps in a recipe. Just as each step in cooking contributes to the final dish, each row in knitting builds up the fabric of your garment. By counting rows, you ensure that the pattern looks consistent and the garment turns out the right size and shape.

## Features: 

- Tap to Count: Count rows up or down on tap

- Customisable Reminders: The 'reminder' feature prompts for an action on a designated row, making it much more sophisticated than a traditional row counter. Reminders can be configured prompting between a range of rows to represent a section in a knitting pattern or on intervals which is for example useful to decrease on sleeves. 

- Progress bar: By configurating the counter and giving a max number of rows to knit for, a progress bar is displayed on the top. 

- Sounds: Users can toggle sounds on or off according to their preferences.

- Offline Accessibility: the data is stored directly on the device and row counts can be accessed anytime, anywhere, even when offline.

> Responsive Design is still under construction. Currently works best for iPhone SE.
